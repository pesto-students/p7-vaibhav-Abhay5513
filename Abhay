      A web browserâ€™s main function is to render HTML code.

2. High level components of a browser ( UI , Browser engine , Rendering engine,  JS intrepretor , Data storage, 	UI backend, Networking.)

3. Rendering engine is a integral part of a web browser. 
       responsible for displaying requested content. For example if the requested  
       content is HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the              
        parsed content on the screen.

        Its use is to draw text and images on the screen. The engine draws strucutred
        text from a document (HTML), and formats it properly based on the given style
        declarations(Often CSS).

   4. HTML/CSS parsing and rendering - Parsing and Rendering turn the HTML 
       Content into a web page with colours and pictures.
       HTML parsin >>Tokenisation>> Dom Tree
       CSS  Parsin >> Tokenization>> CSSOM tree
       CSSOM and DOM tree are merged to form a render tree
 
    5. Tree Construction which happens inside a browser, when a request is raised;
        The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to form the render tree.
         Render Tree contains only the nodes required to render the page.
         Layout computes the exact position and size of each object.
         The last step is paint, which takes in the final render tree and renders the
         Pixels to the screen.

    6. The scripts in the Process pages are processed in the following order: Pre-
         Process page and Process page.
         > Execution Stages.
         > Activation.
         > Generation.
         > Processing.
         > Completion.
